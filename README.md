cassandra-vm
============

Starts a vm using vagrant and provisions it with cassandra using chef and berkshelf.

I'm trying to get a vm provisioned using just the opscode cookbooks. It's not actually working yet, install thrift causes an error and I don't know how to fix it. Any help would be much appreciated.
